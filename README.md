# Iris Classification Model Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**, based on four key features.

---

## Project Goal

Classify iris flowers into their respective species using the following features:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

---

## Likely Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python

### Core Libraries
- `scikit-learn` — for model building and evaluation
- `pandas`, `numpy` — for data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — for data visualization

### Model Used
- Random Forest Classifier
- (You can use any model you like)
---

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
- Load and explore the Iris dataset.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (if any).
- Scale or normalize features for algorithms sensitive to feature scale.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize feature distributions.
- Plot class separation.
- Generate pair plots for feature relationships.

### 4. Model Building
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train multiple classification models.
- Tune hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Generate confusion matrices.
- Produce classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score).
- Visualize decision boundaries and feature importances.

### 6. Deployment/Usage
- Create scripts or notebooks to predict species from new input data.

## Example Results

- **Accuracy:**  
  Most models achieve over **95%** accuracy on the Iris dataset.

- **Visualizations:**  
  - Decision boundary plots.
  - Confusion matrices.
  - Feature importance charts.
